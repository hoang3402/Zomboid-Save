# This system allows you to gain/lose trait in more random and not in so meta-game way. How it works is that when you qualify for adding/removing a trait (list of traits that are affected by this system can be found on google sheets, link in workshop description) you don't get/lose it instantly. Instead, it's added to a table with amount of hours it can take to get it (based on sandbox settings below). Then, every hour, game is rolling for you to get/lose every trait in this table (each trait is rolled separately). So you get 1 in X chance to get your trait every hour. If roll fails, X is reduced by 1. So longer you go, higher chances of trait that you earned to catch up with you.
# IMPORTANT: traits that rely on skill levels will be unlocked as described above. However, traits that rely on internal counters added by this mod (example: Prone To Illness, Weak Stomach, Outdoorsman, Cat Eyes, etc) will unlock next time that they have to increase those internal counters. It'll be this way because coding separate unlock mechanism for those specific traits is a pain and a lot of extra unneeded work. Example: You qualify for Cat Eyes, and it's added to Delayed Traits Table. Let's say some time later you roll success in gaining it in the middle of the day. You won't get it straight away, but you'll get it as soon as Cat Eyes counter increases next time (the closest evening/night). All these specific cases are noted on google sheets.

# Mod tracks at which hours you like to sleep, and as long as you sleep within around those hours, you reinforce your healthy sleep schedule. If you sleep outside of it, you lose some schedule integrity. Not sleeping for more than 24h also starts to damage your sleep schedule. Mod tracks at which hours you like to sleep by checking midpoint of your last sleep, so it's possible to shift your schedule to different hours.
# ---Technical description, don't read this if you don't want to meta-game much---
# Every time you sleep, mod tracks midpoint of your sleep, so if u sleep between 23:00 and 05:30, midpoint would be 03:45, and it would be your optimal sleeping hour. If you sleep within +-6h you get progress to your SleepHealthiness bar. Goes from -200 to 200. Check is made every 10 min, you get + 0.167 to said bar, so essentially 1h of sleeping in correct schedule gives +1 to bar. Sleeping outside of it removes 0.167 from bar every 10 min. After not sleeping for more than 24h you start getting -0.167 every ten minutes. If your bar below -100, you get Sleepyhead. If it's above 100, you get Wakeful.

# ---General understanding---
# This perk allows you to gain a benefit by filling and maintaining a bloodlust meter. The bloodlust meter is soft-capped at 36 hours and can be filled by killing zombies within a certain distance. The closer the zombies are, the more quickly the meter will fill. When you're above half of the meter, every hour it will give you progress towards the bloodlust perk, when it's below, it'll remove progress. The bloodlust meter is naturally decaying by 1 every hour.
# ---Technical description, don't read this if you don't want to meta-game much---
# To fill the bloodlust meter, you must kill zombies within a certain distance from you. The exact amount the meter fills is determined by a formula that takes into account the distance of the zombies and a multiplier. The precise formula is: math.min(1 / distance, 1) * multiplier. Every hour, the meter is reduced by one hour. If your bloodlust meter is above half, every hour you will gain 10% of it as progress towards gaining the bloodlust perk. If it's below 50%, you'll lose 3.6-0.1*BloodlustBar, so if you slightly below 50% you lose around 1.8 but if you're at 0%, you'll lose 3.6 from your progress.

# ---Technical description, don't read this if you don't want to meta-game much---
# To earn points for this perk, you must see and observe squares within a 30 radius of your character. The exact number of points you earn for each square is determined by a formula that takes into account the darkness of the square, the time of day, and whether you and the square are inside or outside. The detailed formula for calculating points for each square is: 0.01 * darkness of square * 2 (if both player and square are inside) * time of day.

EvolvingTraitsWorld.Outdoorsman=true

# ---General understanding---
# This allows you to gain a trait by spending time outside and being exposed to various weather conditions. The more adverse the weather conditions are, the more quickly you will gain the trait. Being inside slowly loses progress. Reaching counter will gain the trait, dropping down to half will lose it.
# ---Technical details---
# Every minute you spend outside will add 1 point to a counter. The rate at which the counter increases is further multiplied by certain weather conditions, such as rain, snow, and wind. When the counter reaches specified threshold, you will gain the trait. From testing, it has been determined that spending 24 hours in clear weather with one foggy morning will result in approximately 1.7k points, while spending 24 hours in weather with two foggy mornings and a storm at midday will result in approximately 5k points. If you're inside, you lose 10% of what you'd gain if you'd be outside. This has liner scaling to 100% over the course of 900 minutes of being inside. You can reset current % at which you lose point by being outside. You decrease % by 0.3 for each minute being outside (You can go from 100% to 10% in 300 minutes).
