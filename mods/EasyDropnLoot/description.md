Drop and Loot items of the same category into or out of your inventory.

Tired of sorting items into different containers? Use this mod to automatically put all items of the same category into open inventory, so you don't have to worry about it!

This is a compromise between manually moving items between inventories and having items to be automatically sorted into nearby containers.
Players still need to select which inventory to use (e.g., equipped Duffel Bag) and which container to use (e.g., Crate).

[h1]Features[/h1]
[list]
[*] Transfer Category - items from player's inventory are transferred into a container only if the container already got items of the same type
[*] Loot Category - items from loot inventory are transferred into a player's inventory only if the player's inventory already got items of the same type
[*] Drop (category) - transfers items of the same category as a selected item (or multiple categories if multiple items selected) between player's inventory and loot inventory
[*] Grab (category) - transfers items of the same category as a selected item (or multiple categories if multiple items selected) between loot and player's inventory inventory
[*] Favorite and Equipped items are ignored
