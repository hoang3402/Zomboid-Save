description=<RGB:1,0.6,0.2>Made for Build 41.65 <RGB:0.3,1,0.6><LINE><LINE>This addon to my Water Tank Trucks adds Water Tank Trailer based off '82 Oshkosh M911 Fuel Trailer by KI5. <LINE>Compatibility is not guaranteed in case of updates of KI5s mod (His changes to fuel trailer script will not influence water tank trailer added by this sub-mod, but any changes to model will). <LINE>Big thank you to KI5 for allowing me to prepare water version of his trailer and for providing me with new textures.
